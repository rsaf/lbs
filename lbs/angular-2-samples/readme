The project uses TypeScript, so to get started you may have to run the following:

1-Install the TypeScript compiler: npm install -g typescript@^1.6.0

2-Run npm install and bower install

Steps 1-2 takes care of installing required tooling.

The final step is to start the TypeScript compiler to transpile your TypeScript code to JavaScript.

I like to run it as a watch in order to automatically regenerate whenever I change my TypeScript.
Use the following command to start watching your files:

tsc --watch -m commonjs -t es5 --emitDecoratorMetadata --experimentalDecorators --jsx react app.ts

The above steps will build all dependencies, so all you have to do now is launch index.html. You can use any type of webserver you want since it's just a static html page. I generally do it from Webstorm by right clicking
index.html and selecting 'Run index.html'.

Note: If you're just browsing the project without making code changes - launching index.html is all you need since the transpiled JavaScript is already under source control. In other words, the TypeScript setup is only needed for people
who want to change the code and regenerate the JavaScript.
