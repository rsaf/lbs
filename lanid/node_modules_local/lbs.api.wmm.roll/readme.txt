test depends on the cmm, to get that dependency without having to re install it you can softlink it:
in dev/bitbucket/lbs.api.wmm.yourbranche/node_modules use the following command:
ln -s ../../../lbs.api.cmm.development/ cmm

Assume that you have the cmm development branche checked out.

In grunt there is a helper to drop the database (grunt dropdb)
The integration tests will drop the database before running if the option --dropdb=true is given.
For this to work you need to soft link to mongodb, issue the following command in test/node
ln -s cmm/node_modules/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb/ mongodb
